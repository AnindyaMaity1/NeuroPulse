What's in this image? Do you find anything wrong with it medically? 
If you make a differential, suggest some remedies for them. Do not add any numbers or special characters in 
your response. Your response should be in one long paragraph. Also always answer as if you are answering to a real person.
Do not say 'In the image I see' but say 'With what I see, I think you have ....'
Don't respond as an AI model in markdown. Your answer should mimic that of an actual doctor, not an AI bot. 
Keep your answer concise (max 2 sentences). No preamble, start your answer right away please."""
